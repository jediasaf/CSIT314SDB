Went in and opened the box, realised it was sealed in a reheatable pack! well I opened it and ate the popcorn but guess what? The popcorn is cold on the inside. Have never tried a cold popcorn. well the caramel popcorn in other cinemas has never gone wrong though. Honestly I am pretty disappointed.', 3),

The halls are decent sized with high backed seats where you could feel the head rest. And the front row is not too close to the screen. Temperature is set comfortably without feeling cold even when I arrive in my singlet and shorts. The only reasons I have given 3 stars are: staff are not so customer friendly and the corridor reeks of a smell of unwashed feet sometimes. Get though the staff and the corridor and your experience will be quite superb.	', 3),
(65, 'mrainforth27@admin.ch', 'Horrible service by the aunty manning the queue cashier. We were still deciding on what to get when she gestured to us as in a hurried manner. Told her we are still deciding. When we have decided, she took a while to get our orders. After taking our orders, she collected payment and rushed me to move away as she wanted to serve the customer after me. Throughout the entire interaction,  she was nothing but pushy and borderline rude. Never have I had any problems in other cinemas besides this. I regret giving this cinema a chance.', 1),

I was collecting drinks and popcorn from a staff called Colleen today. Long story short, she scooped ice into my cup and an ice cube fell out of the cup. I saw that she used her bare hand to swipe the ice into the ice box, and then proceeded to take my cash payment. It is quite disturbing that such a sloppy action could happen when Singapore just exited a challenging COVID era. I could only attribute such action to a lack of robust training and oversight on the part of the management. This is unbecoming and I urge the management to look into how employees are trained and supervised.', 1),

The staff was constantly prowling around and immediately targeting any audience whose food/drinks were not from the cinema.  It was understandable that the rules clearly stated that No outside food and drinks are allowed and the staff were merely carrying out their duties. However,  it was highly distracting for the staff to come in and out of the cinema just to tell the audience that outside food and drinks weren\'t allowed and to put them away.
