1,The staff was polite and really nice theater but  but there's absolutely no place to sit down if you're waiting to enter the theater which they won't let you do until 10 minutes prior to Showtime... My wife has a back problem and my mother has MS.. I mean come on guys put some benches out!? Plenty of space in the lobby for some sitting space.,3
2,"It's wonderful experience to watch the movies, the sound quality is very good, but have the ticket counter to buy the ticket physically",5
3,"Small but wonderful theater!  Excellent picture quality and sound! Comfortable seating! Highly recommended.	",5
4,"Unprofessional staff at snacks counter. Placed an order and staff started cracking jokes about item and quantity ordered in our presence... For the price we pay for the experience and the food, the standard of service should increase substantially",1
5,"New and comfortable seats, The seats are better and more spacious than the seats in other cinemas. Good sound system and larger screens.",5
6,Went to watch there twice. Both times Im satisfied with the hall condition.  As for beverages and purchase of popcorn shall have to wait awhile as they will serve u hot and nice.,5
7,"I went there for a movie and it was one of the best I have been too! great theater. good prices for food and movies.	",5
8,Clean and spacious seats! Can't watch a movie without popcorn and drink!,5
9,Good place to watch movie. But very cold. Do remember to bring a jacket.,4
10,1st time patron since it opened.  Was impressed with the leg space between back and front seats.  The sound system was good and the Cinema halls were kept clean too. Will go more often from now on.,5
11,The Best thing about this place is.... NOT Many people... so you can really enjoy your movies…,4
12,"Worst experience ever. They didn't even turn on the speakers. Only one speaker was working. It was like watching the movie in television. Don't bother wasting your money and coming, might as well go somewhere else or stay at home.",1
13,"Small but has a good number of theaters. Air conditioning is strong, so bring a jacket",4
14,Love the spaciousness of the cinemas. There's definitely ample leg space for people to pass through. The seats are also pretty comfortable,5
15,"Nice ambience, good place for movies. Except movie ticket prices are getting higher and the food amount is getting lesser.",4
16,Watch on weekday is not crowded at all. Theater is nice and clean. Restroom is in another side of theater. It takes a bit of time for a break during long movie.,5
17, I was at theatre 3 and is not that big. Very clean but super cold. Pls bring along jacket!,5
18,"Nice theatre seats but the food is limited and average, especially the popcorn.",4
19,"Like any other cinemas for the normal theatre, the popcorn served was stale and did not have much flavour. The seats were hard and cold, but I did enjoy the movie.",2
20,"Great customer service, although the waiting time for drinks order was a little longer. Nevertheless, it was a lovely environment, and it was such a great experience",5
21,"This cinema has the highest and strictest standard of ""No outside food and drinks"" I have ever seen in my life. The staff was constantly prowling around and immediately targeting any audience whose food/drinks were not from the cinema.  It was understandable that the rules clearly stated that No outside food and drinks are allowed and the staff were merely carrying out their duties. However,  it was highly distracting for the staff to come in and out of the cinema just to tell the audience that outside food and drinks weren't allowed and to put them away. This really took the whole cinema experience away, and it became hard to enjoy the movie. Will not ever come here again!",1
22,"The cinema itself was good but the service was poor.  When waiting in the queue, there was sprite spilled all over the place and people had to walk on it and get their shoes covered in syrup.  Then the queue was slow as there were only 3 people working the counter.  I happen to get the manager and he was working as a cashier because he said they were understaffed today because it was a holiday.",2
23,"Abit cold, remember to bring a jacket but the seats are very comfy and the screen is very big",4
24, The counter service could be more friendly. It was not busy the moment I came. They did not offer food delivery service as my show already started but one of the food item needs to be cooked.,3
25," They will literally prowl every single cinema hall, searching for every customer who consumes outside food to either stop eating or leave the hall, causing much disturbance to the whole experience and completely destroy the mood. Utterly disappointed.",1
26,"The cinema is clean, with facilities to bin litter. Proper signages are displayed for patrons. Snacks  can also be purchased on site. The cinema has vending machines conveniently placed for additional snacks. Air-conditioning was really good and the place was clean. The customer service staff though were not exactly friendly especially the gentleman manning the gate.  He seemed indifferent and did not bother to say """"welcome"""" nor bothered to acknowledge my """"thank you"".",4
27,"Theatre itself not bad as i have been there before but I went to buy tickets for a m18 movie, i am 18 this year,  the guy at the cashier already checked my IC before letting me buy the tickets then the uncle refused entry? Had to change movies because food and drinks were already purchased. Unpleasant experience.",2
28,"Wow, what a great experience I have with my family members. This place is wonderful and amazing. I never regret the money I spend in this place with my family members. They deserve more than five star, because they have everything that you want, and is good for a relaxing day, and also have good bars around the location. Anyway there staff make me enjoy my stay I appreciate a lot, not only that, the prices of there tickets is very good.",5
29,There is no issue for tall ppl. If you are not tall enough... You may have free ppl head in front while watching movie. Can't believe this till happen on 2023. All the seats is almost same level.,1
30,"I thought long and hard about giving this review, and I hate giving negative reviews because it may mean affecting a staff, but whilst I could live with bad services (which I clarify is not the case here), I could not live with bad hygienic practices. I was collecting drinks and popcorn from a staff called Colleen today. Long story short, she scooped ice into my cup and an ice cube fell out of the cup. I saw that she used her bare hand to swipe the ice into the ice box, and then proceeded to take my cash payment. It is quite disturbing that such a sloppy action could happen when Singapore just exited a challenging COVID era. I could only attribute such action to a lack of robust training and oversight on the part of the management. This is unbecoming and I urge the management to look into how employees are trained and supervised.",1
31,"Good theater for spend time together with family, but better book ticket in advance so you have more choice of schedule & seats. The snack cheese meatballs always be favorite for my kids.",5
32, Good: Huge theater. Usually able to get tickets for popular movie. Cushion are still nicely filled so was quite comfortable. Usual spot to catch my marvel movies. Bad: most seats are abit tilted downwards. Might have a bad posture if movie is long.,4
33,"  Popcorn was stale and tasted off. Seats are very uncomfortable too, and the theatre was very cold. I highly do not advise anyone to come here.",1
34,"The cinema is spacious and clean. However, the food is terrible. Bought a GOURMET caramel popcorn and well I thought how can a popcorn go wrong right? Went in and opened the box, realised it’s sealed in a ‘reheatable pack’… well I opened it and ate the popcorn but guess what? The popcorn is cold on the inside…. Have never tried a cold popcorn… well the caramel popcorn in other cinemas has never gone wrong though. Honestly I’m pretty disappointed.",3
35,Thank you Mehwin for the exceptional service! this is what customer service should be like… she opened the cashier for us even when the counter was closed & our chitchat made all of our days better :),5
36,Cinema hall 2 has chairs that slopes DOWNWARDS! most uncomfortable movie experience ever. Never going again.,1
37,"Wide range of snacks but the air conditioning had to improve as the midway of the movie feels stuffy but overall ok ..	",3
38,"The cinema needs to have better queue management dividing signs. There are queue dividers with queue stickers tags on the floor, yet i was told to queue up and join another queue when it was my turn as if i did not queue up at all. The queue divider gap was in the first place not closed, and the counter that the queue led up to was served with a counter lady. Time was wasted to queue up for this misleading """"queue"""" and to join another queue which your team could have better managed it. There was a staff sitting by the entrance during this time, and upon seeing the situation i faced also did not bother managing and shifting the dividers to close up the gap which could have led another patron to queue up for nothing.",1
39,"Seriously, it's the worst seat I have ever sat to watch a movie. It was so uncomfortable.  I hope they change all the seats, or revamp the area. At least invest in the experience and not just suck our money dry.",2
40,"Poor sound quality, totally ruined my movie experience. I would have gotten better viewing at my home speakers. Disappointed..Even after I complaint about it, the sound was so poor..and it deprived me of the experience that I was expecting.. Please improve your sound systems! I want to give 0 starts but it's not allowing me to post it so going with minimum star 1 .",1
41,Seats way too short for the back. Had zero head support even when slouched and knees far apart to avoid the chair infront of me. I can't come here again solely for this chair shortness. Food served here is pretty good though. Juicy and flavourful meatballs. Best cinema food i've ever tasted!,4
42,Worst seating i have ever seen. The seating is worst than Scoot flights. There is hardly any leg room. The whole row of ppl had to move out to make way for ppl who wanted to go out during shows.. A proper cinema is expected to have some standards.,1
43,"Seats are also quite small and uncomfortable. Can't wait for the movie to end. Most uncomfortable cinema experience in Singapore. Hard seats and low leg room, it was so terrible. Do not recommend!",1
44," Had my movie in hall 2, where the seats had cracks and were especially uncomfortable. There are better cinemas in Singapore to go to. Please, please do not ever ever come here. Terrible.",1
45,"Horrible service by the aunty manning the queue cashier. We were still deciding on what to get when she gestured to us as in a hurried manner. Told her we are still deciding. When we have decided, she took a while to get our orders. After taking our orders, she collected payment and rushed me to move away as she wanted to serve the customer after me. Throughout the entire interaction,  she was nothing but pushy and borderline rude. Never have I had any problems in other cinemas besides this. I regret giving this cinema a chance.",1
46, Pretty good cinema. The food is good. Only thing i dislike is the carpet smell like dusty air. Not a fan for sensitive nose if i were to compare to other cinema.,4
47,"A bit small, but a decent place for a quick movie. They should hire at least one or two more staff so that the one poor staff doesn't have to run between the food and ticketing counter, otherwise customer service was acceptable.",4
48," Fabulous and way under-rated cinema. I lost my apple earpod and called them 30 minutes after I left the place. They told me they found it and can come and claim immediately. Additionally, nice sound system with ok screen.",5
49,"Movie and film selection was ok, but the seats definitely is not ok. The leg room is almost the same with what you got on economy flight seats. You will eventually knock the person in front you accidentally with that tight leg room, and the person behind you will knock you as well. It is really annoying and it is my first time seeing this kind of tight leg room in a cinema. Will definitely not going back",2
50,Best cinema hideaway from the city area with excellent sound system. Most often able to get tickets with good seats for a popular movie even at last minute.,5
51,Best place to watch during working hrs. Staff r friendly and well kept provided patrons dont munch or eat hot food inside. Aircon n hot food doesnt go together in most place. Esp yellow n blue furniture mall n cinemas. Smell like clogged drain.,4
52,This is the cinema for you and your viewing needs. The cinema is usually very quiet and a perfect place for movies if you want your personal space or with a loved one. The halls are quite spacious and the lighting is nice. There is usually no queue also at the box office and food and drinks counter which is a plus.,5
53,"A neighbourhood cinema and showcases the latest shows. Great for a late night movie that’s close to home. The halls are decent sized with high backed seats where you could feel the head rest. And the front row is not too close to the screen. Temperature is set comfortably without feeling cold even when I arrive in my singlet and shorts. The only reasons I’ve given 3 stars are: staff are not so customer friendly and the corridor reeks of a smell of unwashed feet sometimes. Get though the staff and the corridor and your experience will be quite superb.	",3
54,"Wonderful movie theatre. Magical movie experience everytime we go there. Pre-movie exprerience at the darkened lobby and snack bar is so inviting. Also, the exit is at the same lovely lobby",5
55,"Seats were very spacious, staff were friendly. Only issue was... the popcorn. I was happy to see a generous portion but as soon as I took the first bite, all the excitement went away. They were the blandest popcorn I have ever tasted in my life and not even the caramel could salvage it.",4
56,"One of the great cinemas i visited. Amazing picture quality, good sound system, and the comfortable of their cinema halls, really deserve watching movies from there.. loved it..",5
57,"Nice theatre! Serve both sweet and salty pop corns, the snack bar service was a little rushed but acceptable. Comfortable seats but wish the sound quality to be better!",5
58,"Colder than necessary. The cinema feels aged. The seats are not well placed; if you're shorter, you will be blocked. Also, the sound system is very nuanced: you need to seat in the center block if your want reasonably balanced sound, or you risk being close to pillars which will spoil your visual and aural enjoyment.
It's a cinema you visit once and will not want to come back for a while. Then, you'd forget the cons and then revisit.",3
59,"The cinema hall is cosy. However,  it would be helpful if the lights can be brighter to enable patrons to see better while looking for their seats, before the show starts.",3
60," Staff are racist.
My friend is 20 years old and cannot watch this R21 movie. The old lady said something like: “maybe in China they will let you slide in. In Singapore this will not happen.”
While saying this. Two other staff(one Malay male and 1 female) was laughing behind the counter.
We feel so offended.
And manager said ticket refund will take 2-3 weeks. What a joke.
Never coming to this place again.",1
61,The popcorm served out of a sack was definitely stale and upon requesting they tried to find me a solution but didn't cook up a fresh batch. The popcorn served at the end was cold and stale,3
62,"Awesome layout for a movie theatre, with the cost of the ticket and the combo, it is well worth! 

I would love to see them incorporate some superhero statues or more artwork to the main lobby area.  It did feel a little empty given the size but I’m sure at a premier it would be packed so I may be wrong.

The washrooms here were very clean with ample soap and water available when washing hands.  I was surprised to see a hole in the floor style toilet from year past.

I hope to return here and enjoyed my time,  thank you to the theatre for providing a clean and hygienic environment where I could relax",5
63,"Usual cinema without much funfare. The theatre has scaled down from a few hundreds to perhaps maximum 100 or less. Anyway, this is first time after so many donkey years that I really been to a cinema movie.",4
64, I purchased two tickets on the wrong date. The staff was very helpful. Was able to amend the date without much fuss. Watched the movie on time. My son enjoyed the movie and the popcorn,5
65,"Awesome clean theatre. Perfect sound and viewing quality. Fantastic service when redeeming popcorn.
Aircon was way to cold, do come prepared.
Be better if there's dim lit before show to find our seats",3
66,"The best seats in Singapore thus far! Premium leather seats with comfy back support and spacious leg room. Staff are always friendly, and never fail to put a smile on my family's faces whenever we visit.",5
67,The female manager behind the ticketing counter needs urgent customer service training. The old friendly and helpful gentleman at the ticket check booth should be the manager instead.,2
68,Have been here many times during the last many years and great to see the quality of everything is either same and well maintained or improved. Cheers!,5
69,Great service from the lady staff at the box office who noticed my elderly parents + long showtime and took the initiative to recommend seats that had convinient access to the toilet. She even guided us on how to get to our seats and was knowledgeable and super helpful when we enquired on the current promotions,5
70,"Amazing theatre, very organized and people are very nice. The sound system and the screen is exceptionally good.",5
71,"Was at Hall 1 and seated 2 rows from the back.. Nice big area and seats are elevated a little bit so the front seats will never be blocking you, nice! Only thing is that the screen seemed small from the back (cos the hall is that big) so I advise booking the middle rows for optimal viewing",5
72,"The theatres are pretty standard and basic - seats are packed tightly and you’re closely surrounded by others (who unfortunately sometimes don’t ‘behave’ appropriately - talking/using their phones, burping or eating loudly). Most of the time it is functional as it’s the closest to home but if they renovated or had more premium options that would be nice.",2
73,"Waiting for show, they still take their own sweet time scooping the ice and the popcorn. Then proceeded to give the wrong drink also. Hope they can work on the service.",2
74,Liked the synthetic chair material. Better than cloth ones that cannot be cleaned.,4
75,"Very nice experience, small theaters, brilliant sound system. Aircon very cold, staff is super nice I really enjoyed my movie",5
76,"This cinema is one of those historical cinemas in Singapore. Although being ""old"", it maintains very well its cleanliness, and packed itself with all the latest movies with spacious and comfortable seatings. Another good thing observed here is also the organisation employing senior citizens to give them chances to continue working even at their ages. One of my favourite theatres to visit!",5
77, Still my favorite cinema. Seats are spacious. I watched The Lost City at Hall 1 and its so good to be able to see an almost full house. Wish the guy in front of me isn't so tall tho as my view was a little obstructed.,5
78,"Everything is good but don't forget to wear long pants and bring warm clothes, it's deadly cold inside",5
79,"Watch a movie here. One of the best places to do that. Always look forward to bring my kids here, because they have such a good time. Thank you!",5
80,There is certainly room for improvement for movie guest comforts and enjoyment.,3
81,Good there are toilets in Hall 1 & 4 but the air-conditioning in all halls are too very COLD. Everytime we will have to bring a sweat shirt to put on whenever we visit. Will try to avoid watching movies here if we can. With energy saving should raise the temperature 1 or 2 notch up.,3
82,"Expensive movie tickets, Poor organization and packing of snacks. Overall, other cinemas are way much better in service and professionalism",2
83,An animated movie would be the best choice. Had an OK experience watching Mission Impossible - Fallout. And take a jacket unless you're used to the cold! The theater in itself was quite clean and the movie snacks not very pricey.,3
84,Great cinema nice and clean. I’ve been there a few times now over the year. I forgot my jumper. The aircon is set to freezing cold sorry did I say freezing cold I’m meant freeeeeeerzing cold. If you go there don't forget your jumper.,3
85,"Before the show premiere, the hall 4 is in total darkness. Cannot see and find the numbering on the seats. I would prefer if the lights are on until the actual screening started. Also the flooring are all in steps making it more difficult to find the seats in total darkness. One may accidentally trip and fell especially children or aged adults. Very steep and risky.",3
86,"1. AC too cold at Hall 6.
2. 20 minutes before movie time, Theatre 6 was pitch dark and it didn't feel safe looking for my seat.
3. Developed itchy hives after the movie. Second time it happened here. There was a plastic food container left on the floor by previous user.
4. Many soap dispensers in the ladies' toilet don't work.",1
87,"The outside waiting area is great, plenty of seating area but in the theatre, it's a disaster, totally dark, very dangerous if one doesn't turn on a torch to look for your seat. Not well planned, time for a upgrade.",2
88,"Quickly turning into my favorite place to watch a movie in Singapore. the facility is fantastic, the theaters are new and clean and incredibly comfortable there are so many different movie options that change weekly.",5
89,It was the 1st time I have ever been to that cinema and I thought it was quite good! The only thing I would say is the actual places where you watch the film were really cold from having the air conditioning on full blast! If I went again I would definitely bring a jumper or wear a sweat shirt. The service was good and the staff were nice. I would however only say that the tickets were a bit expensive. I would ultimately still recommend and go back there again.,4
90,"Polite staff, friendly to senior citizens too. The lady who stood around self service counter was alert and patient to clarify our doubts. Gave us additional information too. Ticket booking counter employees (a senior citizen was coaching a new employee on the job) were patient and repeated without hesitation or frustrations. Good service at pop corn counter and fast food packers. Comfy theatre seats and great lighting. Keep up thegood work.",5
91,"Had the worst movie experience with cinema 1 on the first day showing of The Batman! There was a technical problem during the half of the movie. The screen suddenly stopped while we can just hear the sound. Several minutes had passed and yet nobody is there to assist or even update us. After about 10mins or so, two young ladies came in and announced that there was a technical error and it will be fixed. Few more minutes had passed and we can already hear sounds from the screen which I believe is from the movie Spiderman. Then the lights suddenly went on while these two ladies came back to announce that they won’t be continuing the movie due to technical issue and will give us complimentary movie ticket instead!

By the way this happened not once, I remember when we had this movie event in our company and same thing happens. Will never come here to watch any movie again!",1
92,Classic feel GREAT sound system. Only thing is the smell in the theatre. They can do more regular cleaning and the air con is too cold but other than that sound system is excellent    if the movie theatres location is not so complex I would give them 5 stars!,4
93,"Visited this cinema today to try out this cinema for the newly released movie Doctor Strange. I absolutely loved it, no doubt about that. The seat vibrated according to the script and unlike other cinemas in Singapore, the air conditioning was just right, so I did not even had to put on my jacket!",5
94,"It has this old feeling and atmosphere, if you want to watch a movie at the last min, you should be able to get tickets. It's very unfortunate that as it ages, the cinema seats does have an unusual smell.

I do hope they consider adding nice air fresheners to the cinema halls.",3
95,"Quite decent exp thr when I went to watch a movie with my mum.
- cinema is quite clean but air-conditioning can be colder (not too big of an issue tho)
- staffs were all really friendly and tried to help when the kiosk didn't let me buy my tickets -> hence -1 star
- popcorn was nice.",4
96,"Staff was very understanding and friendly, while helping me refund movie tickets

One note: Bring earplugs for when you watch a movie here, because the advertisements/trailer part is extra loud. the actual movie audio volume is fine though",5
97,"Worst movie theatre experience ever! Hall 4 seats are not stepped, they are laid out flat, thus the screen hangs way above sight line. If you dont want to strech and tilt up ur head for straight 2 hours, dont go here. Absolutely sucks!",1
98,"Was just a normal movie experience for the most part but was trapped in the stairwell when i was trying to leave.

the exit the staff member directed me towards led to a locked door and i had no way to go back (one-way push door) or leave. had to call the security guard to let me out and he also said that exit was not to be used by unauthorised personnel which was very weird.

idk if this is company policy but staff members kept walking up and down the aisle while the movie was showing which was quite distracting.

there were also 20 minutes of ads before the film started, next time i'll stick to netflix...",1
99,Went to watch a Tamil movie. Didn't like the theatre at all...it seemed like a huge room with cushioned chairs..thats all. Wouldn't suggest unless you want a neck pain.,3
100,Cinema suddenly blackout halfway through the movie. told us don’t know how long will take to fix but we can wait there till it’s fixed or leave lolllll,1
